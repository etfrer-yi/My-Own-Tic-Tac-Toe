# My-Own-Tic-Tac-Toe
This contains my own implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Java. Player inputs can only be 0, 1, or 2, where 0 denotes the first column/row; 1, the second column/row; 2, the third column/row.

Please note that TicTacToeGrid was a trials version in which I tried to recreate the grid and TocTacToeFinal is the project itself.
